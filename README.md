# Task 04 – Keyboard Event Logger (Safe Version)

This project demonstrates how to capture keystrokes while the program is running in focus and save them to a log file.  
It is **not a hidden keylogger**, but an educational tool to practice input handling and file I/O in Python.

## Features
- Records key presses while program is active
- Saves the sequence of pressed keys to a log file
- Simple file-based logging system

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Type inside the program window.
3. Check the `key_log.txt` file to see the recorded keystrokes.

## Example Output
Key Pressed: h
Key Pressed: e
Key Pressed: l
Key Pressed: l
Key Pressed: o




## Educational Purpose
This tool is intended **only for educational purposes** to demonstrate:
- Event handling
- File writing
- Logging mechanics

⚠️ Note: It is not a malicious keylogger and does not record hidden background input.
